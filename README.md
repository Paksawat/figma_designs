After parting with the company, the developed version is no longer available. 

This was my PBA in cooperation with Universal Robots. With another classmate, we wanted to combine their robot dashboard with their robot health service. 
We redesignet and incorporated to different platforms and ended with a high grade for our finals. 

The developed version was made with Angular JS with a .Net Web API, with all the functions you see in the Figma version, without the sorting option.
